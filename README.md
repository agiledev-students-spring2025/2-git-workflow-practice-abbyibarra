## Article: [The End of Programming as We Know It](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-end-of-programming-as-we-know-it/)
The article discusses how generative AI is transforming software development. In it, the author, Tim O'Reilly suggests that traditional coding may turn into a process where developers will train  AI systems to generate code, and that the role of programmers will shift from writing explicit instructions to guiding AI models, instead. He argues that it is likely a shift like this might result in more efficient development processes and open new doors for innovation in software creation.

What I thought made this article interesting is that it really questions how traditional programming is and how technology continuously changes. As AI systems continue to improve, the required skills of a software developer might also change and place greater emphasis on professional adaptability and lifelong learning. It further raises questions about what working with technology in the future will look like and the potential ethical issues of AI-generated code.

## Comment:

I think the article makes a great point that AI will enhance, not replace, programmers by shifting the focus to higher-level problem-solving. I also agree that those who embrace AI as a tool will have a significant advantage, much like past generations of developers who adapted to new programming paradigms.
